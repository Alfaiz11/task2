# Task 2
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here I performs detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, distributions, correlations, and outliers that influence passenger survival.

---

## Objectives of EDA

- Generate descriptive statistics
- Visualize feature distributions
- Detect outliers and anomalies
- Analyze correlations and feature relationships
- Make feature-level inferences

---

## EDA Tasks Performed

### 1. Summary Statistics

- Used `.describe()`, `.info()`, and `.median()` to explore:
  - Mean, median, standard deviation, min/max
  - Data types and null values

### 2. Visualizations

#### ðŸ”¹ Histograms
- Showed distribution of numerical features like `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`

#### ðŸ”¹ Boxplots
- Detected outliers in numerical features

## Key Insights

- **Sex**: Females had higher survival rates
- **Fare**: Higher-paying passengers were more likely to survive
- **Age**: Young children had slightly better survival rates
- **Pclass**: 1st class passengers had a higher chance of survival
- Some features like `SibSp` and `Parch` showed complex effects depending on family size
